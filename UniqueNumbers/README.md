To solve the problem of extracting unique values from the input file numbersFile, I would employ a straightforward algorithmic approach. First, I would read the content of the file and parse each line to extract the numerical values. Then, I would utilize a data structure such as a HashSet to efficiently store and identify unique values while iterating through the parsed numbers. The HashSet data structure provides constant-time average complexity for insertion and lookup, making it well-suited for this task. By inserting each number into the HashSet, duplicates are automatically eliminated, and we are left with only the unique values. Finally, the unique values can be outputted in any order, as per the assumption that the order of the output is not relevant. This approach ensures both efficiency and simplicity in identifying and outputting unique values from the input file.
